  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Authorization is the process for granting approval to an entity to access a resource <a href="#RFC4949">[RFC4949]</a>. The authorization task itself can best be described as granting access to a requesting client, for a resource hosted on a device, the resource server (RS).  This exchange is mediated by one or multiple authorization servers (AS). Managing authorization for a large number of devices and users can be a complex task. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">While prior work on authorization solutions for the Web and for the mobile environment also applies to the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, many IoT devices are constrained, for example, in terms of processing capabilities, available memory, etc. For web applications on constrained nodes, this specification RECOMMENDS the use of CoAP <a href="#RFC7252">[RFC7252]</a> as replacement for HTTP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">A detailed treatment of constraints can be found in <a href="#RFC7228">[RFC7228]</a>, and the different IoT deployments present a continuous range of device and network capabilities.  Taking energy consumption as an example: At one end there are energy-harvesting or battery powered devices which have a tight power budget, on the other end there are mains-powered devices, and all levels in between.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Hence, IoT devices may be very different in terms of available processing and message exchange capabilities and there is a need to support many different authorization use cases <a href="#RFC7744">[RFC7744]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This specification describes a framework for authentication and authorization in constrained environments (ACE) built on re-use of OAuth 2.0 <a href="#RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a>, thereby extending authorization to Internet of Things devices.  This specification contains the necessary building blocks for adjusting OAuth 2.0 to IoT environments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">More detailed, interoperable specifications can be found in profiles.  Implementations may claim conformance with a specific profile, whereby implementations utilizing the same profile interoperate while implementations of different profiles are not expected to be interoperable.  Some devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, may implement multiple profiles and will therefore be able to interact with a wider range of low end devices.  Requirements on profiles are described at contextually appropriate places throughout this specification, and also summarized in <a href="#app:profileRequirements">Appendix C</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#terminology" id="terminology">Terminology</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a> <a href="#RFC8174">[RFC8174]</a> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">Certain security-related terms such as "authentication", "authorization", "confidentiality", "(data) integrity", "message authentication code", and "verify" are taken from <a href="#RFC4949">[RFC4949]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">Since exchanges in this specification are described as RESTful protocol interactions, HTTP <a href="#RFC7231">[RFC7231]</a> offers useful terminology.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.4">Terminology for entities in the architecture is defined in OAuth 2.0 <a href="#RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a> such as client (C), resource server (RS), and authorization server (AS).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.5">Note that the term "endpoint" is used here following its OAuth definition, which is to denote resources such as token and introspection at the AS and authz-info at the RS (see <a href="#tokenAuthInfoEndpoint">Section 5.8.1</a> for a definition of the authz-info endpoint).  The CoAP <a href="#RFC7252">[RFC7252]</a> definition, which is "An entity participating in the CoAP protocol" is not used in this specification.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">The specifications in this document is called the "framework" or "ACE framework".  When referring to "profiles of this framework" it refers to additional specifications that define the use of this specification with concrete transport, and communication security protocols (e.g., CoAP over DTLS).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.7">We use the term "Access Information" for parameters other than the access token provided to the client by the AS to enable it to access the RS (e.g. public key of the RS, profile supported by RS).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> <a href="#overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This specification defines the ACE framework for authorization in the Internet of Things environment. It consists of a set of building blocks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">The basic block is the OAuth 2.0 <a href="#RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a> framework, which enjoys widespread deployment.  Many IoT devices can support OAuth 2.0 without any additional extensions, but for certain constrained settings additional profiling is needed.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Another building block is the lightweight web transfer protocol CoAP <a href="#RFC7252">[RFC7252]</a>, for those communication environments where HTTP is not appropriate.  CoAP typically runs on top of UDP, which further reduces overhead and message exchanges. While this specification defines extensions for the use of OAuth over CoAP, other underlying protocols are not prohibited from being supported in the future, such as HTTP/2, MQTT, BLE and QUIC.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">A third building block is CBOR <a href="#RFC7049">[RFC7049]</a>, for encodings where JSON <a href="#RFC8259">[RFC8259]</a> is not sufficiently compact.  CBOR is a binary encoding designed for small code and message size, which may be used for encoding of self contained tokens, and also for encoding payload transferred in protocol messages.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">A fourth building block is the compact CBOR-based secure message format COSE <a href="#RFC8152">[RFC8152]</a>, which enables application layer security as an alternative or complement to transport layer security (DTLS <a href="#RFC6347">[RFC6347]</a> or TLS <a href="#RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a>). COSE is used to secure self-contained tokens such as proof-of-possession (PoP) tokens, which is an extension to the OAuth tokens. The default token format is defined in CBOR web token (CWT) <a href="#RFC8392">[RFC8392]</a>.  Application layer security for CoAP using COSE can be provided with OSCORE <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">With the building blocks listed above, solutions satisfying various IoT device and network constraints are possible.  A list of constraints is described in detail in RFC 7228 <a href="#RFC7228">[RFC7228]</a> and a description of how the building blocks mentioned above relate to the various constraints can be found in <a href="#constraints">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.7">Luckily, not every IoT device suffers from all constraints.  The ACE framework nevertheless takes all these aspects into account and allows several different deployment variants to co-exist, rather than mandating a one-size-fits-all solution.  It is important to cover the wide range of possible interworking use cases and the different requirements from a security point of view.  Once IoT deployments mature, popular deployment variants will be documented in the form of ACE profiles.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#oauth2Overview" id="oauth2Overview">OAuth 2.0</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a client to obtain scoped access to a resource with the permission of a resource owner.  Authorization information, or references to it, is passed between the nodes using access tokens.  These access tokens are issued to clients by an authorization server with the approval of the resource owner.  The client uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">A number of OAuth 2.0 terms are used within this specification: </p>

<dl>
  <dt>The token and introspection Endpoints:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> The AS hosts the token endpoint that allows a client to request access tokens. The client makes a POST request to the token endpoint on the AS and receives the access token in the response (if the request was successful).  <br/> In some deployments, a token introspection endpoint is provided by the AS, which can be used by the RS if it needs to request additional information regarding a received access token.  The RS makes a POST request to the introspection endpoint on the AS and receives information about the access token in the response. (See "Introspection" below.) <br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Access Tokens:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> Access tokens are credentials needed to access protected resources.  An access token is a data structure representing authorization permissions issued by the AS to the client.  Access tokens are generated by the AS and consumed by the RS.  The access token content is opaque to the client.  <br/><br/> Access tokens can have different formats, and various methods of utilization (e.g., cryptographic properties) based on the security requirements of the given deployment.  <br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Refresh Tokens:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner).  Issuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the authorization server.  If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it is included when issuing an access token (i.e., step (B) in <a href="#fig:protocolFlow">Figure 1</a>).  <br/><br/> A refresh token in OAuth 2.0 is a string representing the authorization granted	to the client by the resource owner.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  The token denotes an identifier used to retrieve the authorization information.  Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are intended for use only with authorization servers and are never sent to resource servers.</dd>
  <dt>Proof of Possession Tokens:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> An access token may be bound to a cryptographic key, which is then used by an RS to authenticate requests from a client.  Such tokens are called proof-of-possession access tokens (or PoP access tokens).  <br/><br/> The proof-of-possession (PoP) security concept assumes that the AS acts as a trusted third party that binds keys to access tokens.  These so called PoP keys are then used by the client to demonstrate the possession of the secret to the RS when accessing the resource.  The RS, when receiving an access token, needs to verify that the key used by the client matches the one bound to the access token.  When this specification uses the term "access token" it is assumed to be a PoP access token token unless specifically stated otherwise.  <br/><br/> The key bound to the access token (the PoP key) may use either symmetric or asymmetric cryptography.  The appropriate choice of the kind of cryptography depends on the constraints of the IoT devices as well as on the security requirements of the use case.  <br/><br/> <dl><dt>Symmetric PoP key:</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> The AS generates a random symmetric PoP key.  The key is either stored to be returned on introspection calls or encrypted and included in the access token.  The PoP key is also encrypted for the client and sent together with the access token to the client.<br/><br/> </dd><dt>Asymmetric PoP key:</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> An asymmetric key pair is generated on the client and the public key is sent to the AS (if it does not already have knowledge of the client's public key).  Information about the public key, which is the PoP key in this case, is either stored to be returned on introspection calls or included inside the access token and sent back to the requesting client.  The RS can identify the client's public key from the information in the token, which allows the client to use the corresponding private key for the proof of possession.  </dd></dl><p> </p><br/><br/> The access token is either a simple reference, or a structured information object (e.g., CWT <a href="#RFC8392">[RFC8392]</a>) protected by a cryptographic wrapper (e.g., COSE <a href="#RFC8152">[RFC8152]</a>).  The choice of PoP key does not necessarily imply a specific credential type for the integrity protection of the token.<br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Scopes and Permissions:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> In OAuth 2.0, the client specifies the type of permissions it is seeking to obtain (via the scope parameter) in the access token request.  In turn, the AS may use the scope response parameter to inform the client of the scope of the access token issued.  As the client could be a constrained device as well, this specification defines the use of CBOR encoding as data format, see <a href="#oauthProfile">Section 5</a>, to request scopes and to be informed what scopes the access token actually authorizes.  <br/><br/> The values of the scope parameter in OAuth 2.0 are expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings, with a semantic that is well-known to the AS and the RS.  More details about the concept of scopes is found under Section 3.3 in <a href="#RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a>.<br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Claims:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> Information carried in the access token or returned from introspection, called claims, is in the form of name-value pairs.  An access token may, for example, include a claim identifying the AS that issued the token (via the "iss" claim) and what audience the access token is intended for (via the "aud" claim).  The audience of an access token can be a specific resource or one or many resource servers.  The resource owner policies influence what claims are put into the access token by the authorization server.  <br/><br/> While the structure and encoding of the access token varies throughout deployments, a standardized format has been defined with the JSON Web Token (JWT) <a href="#RFC7519">[RFC7519]</a> where claims are encoded as a JSON object.  In <a href="#RFC8392">[RFC8392]</a>, an equivalent format using CBOR encoding (CWT) has been defined.  <br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Introspection:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> Introspection is a method for a resource server to query the authorization server for the active state and content of a received access token.  This is particularly useful in those cases where the authorization decisions are very dynamic and/or where the received access token itself is an opaque reference rather than a self-contained token.   More information about introspection in OAuth 2.0 can be found in <a href="#RFC7662">[RFC7662]</a>.  </dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#coap" id="coap">CoAP</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">CoAP is an application layer protocol similar to HTTP, but specifically designed for constrained environments.  CoAP typically uses datagram-oriented transport, such as UDP, where reordering and loss of packets can occur.  A security solution needs to take the latter aspects into account.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">While HTTP uses headers and query strings to convey additional information about a request, CoAP encodes such information into header parameters called 'options'.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">CoAP supports application-layer fragmentation of the CoAP payloads through blockwise transfers <a href="#RFC7959">[RFC7959]</a>.  However, blockwise transfer does not increase the size limits of CoAP options, therefore data encoded in options has to be kept small.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.4">Transport layer security for CoAP can be provided by DTLS or TLS <a href="#RFC6347">[RFC6347]</a><a href="#RFC5246">[RFC5246]</a><a href="#RFC8446">[RFC8446]</a> <a href="#I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13">[I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13]</a>.  CoAP defines a number of proxy operations that require transport layer security to be terminated at the proxy. One approach for protecting CoAP communication end-to-end through proxies, and also to support security for CoAP over a different transport in a uniform way, is to provide security at the application layer using an object-based security mechanism such as COSE <a href="#RFC8152">[RFC8152]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.5">One application of COSE is OSCORE <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>, which provides end-to-end confidentiality, integrity and replay protection, and a secure binding between CoAP request and response messages. In OSCORE, the CoAP messages are wrapped in COSE objects and sent using CoAP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.6">This framework RECOMMENDS the use of CoAP as replacement for HTTP for use in constrained environments.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4"><a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#specs" id="specs">Protocol Interactions</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The ACE framework is based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol interactions using the token endpoint and optionally the introspection endpoint.  A client obtains an access token, and optionally a refresh token, from an AS using the token endpoint and subsequently presents the access token to a RS to gain access to a protected resource. In most deployments the RS can process the access token locally, however in some cases the RS may present it to the AS via the introspection endpoint to get fresh information.  These interactions are shown in <a href="#fig:protocolFlow">Figure 1</a>.  An overview of various OAuth concepts is provided in <a href="#oauth2Overview">Section 3.1</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The OAuth 2.0 framework defines a number of "protocol flows" via grant types, which have been extended further with extensions to OAuth 2.0 (such as RFC 7521 <a href="#RFC7521">[RFC7521]</a> and <a href="#I-D.ietf-oauth-device-flow">[I-D.ietf-oauth-device-flow]</a>).  What grant types works best depends on the usage scenario and RFC 7744 <a href="#RFC7744">[RFC7744]</a> describes many different IoT use cases but there are two preferred grant types, namely the Authorization Code Grant (described in Section 4.1 of <a href="#RFC7521">[RFC7521]</a>) and the Client Credentials Grant (described in Section 4.4 of <a href="#RFC7521">[RFC7521]</a>). The Authorization Code Grant is a good fit for use with apps running on smart phones and tablets that request access to IoT devices, a common scenario in the smart home environment, where users need to go through an authentication and authorization phase (at least during the initial setup phase). The native apps guidelines described in <a href="#RFC8252">[RFC8252]</a> are applicable to this use case. The Client Credential Grant is a good fit for use with IoT devices where the OAuth client itself is constrained. In such a case, the resource owner has pre-arranged access rights for the client with the authorization server, which is often accomplished using a commissioning tool.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The consent of the resource owner, for giving a client access to a protected resource, can be provided dynamically as in the traditional OAuth flows, or it could be pre-configured by the resource owner as authorization policies at the AS, which the AS evaluates when a token request arrives.

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">This framework supports a wide variety of communication security mechanisms between the ACE entities, such as client, AS, and RS. It is assumed that the client has been registered (also called enrolled or onboarded) to an AS using a mechanism defined outside the scope of this document.  In practice, various techniques for onboarding have been used, such as factory-based provisioning or the use of commissioning tools. Regardless of the onboarding technique, this provisioning procedure implies that the client and the AS exchange credentials and configuration parameters.  These credentials are used to mutually authenticate each other and to protect messages exchanged between the client and the AS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.5">It is also assumed that the RS has been registered with the AS, potentially in a similar way as the client has been registered with the AS.  Established keying material between the AS and the RS allows the AS to apply cryptographic protection to the access token to ensure that its content cannot be modified, and if needed, that the content is confidentiality protected.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.6">The keying material necessary for establishing communication security between C and RS is dynamically established as part of the protocol described in this document.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.7">At the start of the protocol, there is an optional discovery step where the client discovers the resource server and the resources this server hosts.  In this step, the client might also determine what permissions are needed to access the protected resource.  A generic procedure is described in <a href="#asDiscovery">Section 5.1</a>, profiles MAY define other procedures for discovery.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.8">In Bluetooth Low Energy, for example, advertisements are broadcasted by a peripheral, including information about the primary services.

<dl>
  <dt>Requesting an Access Token (A):</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> The client makes an access token request to the token endpoint at the AS.  This framework assumes the use of PoP access tokens (see <a href="#oauth2Overview">Section 3.1</a> for a short description) wherein the AS binds a key to an access token.  The client may include permissions it seeks to obtain, and information about the credentials it wants to use (e.g., symmetric/asymmetric cryptography or a reference to a specific credential).<br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Access Token Response (B):</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> If the AS successfully processes the request from the client, it returns an access token and optionally a refresh token (note that only certain grant types support refresh tokens).  It can also return additional parameters, referred to as "Access Information".  In addition to the response parameters defined by OAuth 2.0 and the PoP access token extension, this framework defines parameters that can be used to inform the client about capabilities of the RS. More information about these parameters can be found in <a href="#tokenParams">Section 5.6.4</a>.  <br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Resource Request (C):</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> The client interacts with the RS to request access to the protected resource and provides the access token.  The protocol to use between the client and the RS is not restricted to CoAP. HTTP, HTTP/2, QUIC, MQTT, Bluetooth Low Energy, etc., are also viable candidates.  <br/><br/> Depending on the device limitations and the selected protocol, this exchange may be split up into two parts: <ul class="empty"><li>(1) the client sends the access token containing, or referencing, the authorization information to the RS, that may be used for subsequent resource requests by the client, and </li><li>(2) the client makes the resource access request, using the communication security protocol and other Access Information obtained from the AS.</li></ul><p> </p><br/><br/> The Client and the RS mutually authenticate using the security protocol specified in the profile (see step B) and the keys obtained in the access token or the Access Information.  The RS verifies that the token is integrity protected by the AS and compares the claims contained in the access token with the resource request. If the RS is online, validation can be handed over to the AS using token introspection (see messages D and E) over HTTP or CoAP.<br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Token Introspection Request (D):</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> A resource server may be configured to introspect the access token by including it in a request to the introspection endpoint at that AS.  Token introspection over CoAP is defined in <a href="#introspectionEndpoint">Section 5.7</a> and for HTTP in <a href="#RFC7662">[RFC7662]</a>.  <br/><br/> Note that token introspection is an optional step and can be omitted if the token is self-contained and the resource server is prepared to perform the token validation on its own.<br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Token Introspection Response (E):</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> The AS validates the token and returns the most recent parameters, such as scope, audience, validity etc. associated with it back to the RS.  The RS then uses the received parameters to process the request to either accept or to deny it.<br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Protected Resource (F):</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> If the request from the client is authorized, the RS fulfills the request and returns a response with the appropriate response code.  The RS uses the dynamically established keys to protect the response, according to used communication security protocol.  </dd>

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">The following sections detail the profiling and extensions of OAuth 2.0 for constrained environments, which constitutes the ACE framework.  </p>
<p/>

<dl>
  <dt>Credential Provisioning</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> For IoT, it cannot be assumed that the client and RS are part of a common key infrastructure, so the AS provisions credentials or associated information to allow mutual authentication. These credentials need to be provided to the parties before or during the authentication protocol is executed, and may be re-used for subsequent token requests.  <br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Proof-of-Possession</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> The ACE framework, by default, implements proof-of-possession for access tokens, i.e., that the token holder can prove being a holder of the key bound to the token.  The binding is provided by the "cnf" claim <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession">[I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession]</a> indicating what key is used for	proof-of-possession. If a client needs to submit a new access token, e.g., to obtain additional access rights, they can request that the AS binds this token to the same key as the previous one.  <br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>ACE Profiles</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/> The client or RS may be limited in the encodings or protocols it supports.  To support a variety of different deployment settings, specific interactions between client and RS are defined in an ACE profile.  In ACE framework the AS is expected to manage the matching of compatible profile choices between a client and an RS.  The AS informs the client of the selected profile using the "profile" parameter in the token response.  </dd>
</dl>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">OAuth 2.0 requires the use of TLS both to protect the communication between AS and client when requesting an access token; between client and RS when accessing a resource and between AS and RS if introspection is used.  In constrained settings TLS is not always feasible, or desirable.  Nevertheless it is REQUIRED that the data exchanged with the AS is encrypted, integrity protected and protected against message replay.  It is also REQUIRED that the AS and the endpoint communicating with it (client or RS) perform mutual authentication.  Furthermore it MUST be assured that responses are bound to the requests in the sense that the receiver of a response can be certain that the response actually belongs to a certain request.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">Profiles MUST specify a communication security protocol that provides the features required above.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">In OAuth 2.0 the communication with the Token and the Introspection endpoints at the AS is assumed to be via HTTP and may use Uri-query parameters.  When profiles of this framework use CoAP instead, this framework REQUIRES the use of the following alternative instead of Uri-query parameters: The sender (client or RS) encodes the parameters of its request as a CBOR map and submits that map as the payload  of the POST request.  Profiles that use CBOR encoding of protocol message parameters MUST use the media format 'application/ace+cbor', unless the protocol message is wrapped in another Content-Format (e.g. object security). If CoAP is used for communication, the Content-Format MUST be abbreviated with the ID: 19 (see <a href="#IANAcoapContentFormat">Section 8.15</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.6">The OAuth 2.0 AS uses a JSON structure in the payload of its responses both to client and RS.  If CoAP is used, this framework REQUIRES the use of CBOR <a href="#RFC7049">[RFC7049]</a> instead of JSON.  Depending on the profile, the CBOR payload MAY be enclosed in a non-CBOR cryptographic wrapper.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The request has been received on an unprotected channel.</li>
  <li>RS has no valid access token for the sender of the request regarding the requested action on that resource.</li>
  <li>RS has a valid access token for the sender of the request, but this does not allow the requested action on the requested resource.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">To request an access token, the client obtains authorization from the resource owner or uses its client credentials as grant.  The authorization is expressed in the form of an authorization grant.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">The OAuth framework <a href="#RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a> defines four grant types. The grant types can be split up into two groups, those granted on behalf of the resource owner (password, authorization code, implicit) and those for the client (client credentials). Further grant types have been added later, such as <a href="#RFC7521">[RFC7521]</a> defining an assertion-based authorization grant.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">The grant type is selected depending on the use case.  In cases where the client acts on behalf of the resource owner, authorization code grant is recommended.  If the client acts on behalf of the resource owner, but does not have any display or very limited interaction possibilities it is recommended to use the device code grant defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-oauth-device-flow">[I-D.ietf-oauth-device-flow]</a>.  In cases where the client does not act on behalf of the resource owner, client credentials grant is recommended.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">For details on the different grant types, see the OAuth 2.0 framework <a href="#RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a>. The OAuth 2.0 framework provides an extension mechanism for defining additional grant types so profiles of this framework MAY define additional grant types, if needed.</p>

Furthermore, this framework defines encodings using CBOR, as a substitute for JSON.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.2">The endpoint may, however, be exposed over HTTPS as in classical OAuth or even other transports.  A profile MUST define the details of the mapping between the fields described below, and these transports.  If HTTPS is used, JSON or CBOR payloads may be supported.

If CBOR payload is supported, the semantics described below MUST be followed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.3">For the AS to be able to issue a token, the client MUST be authenticated and present a valid grant for the scopes requested.  Profiles of this framework MUST specify how the AS authenticates the client and how the communication between client and AS is protected.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.8.p.1">This framework RECOMMENDS the use of CBOR web token (CWT) as specified in <a href="#RFC8392">[RFC8392]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.p.2">In order to facilitate offline processing of access tokens, this draft uses the "cnf" claim from <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession">[I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession]</a> and specifies the "scope" claim for both JSON and CBOR web tokens.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.p.3">The "scope" claim explicitly encodes the scope of a given access token.  This claim follows the same encoding rules as defined in Section 3.3 of <a href="#RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a>, but in addition implementers MAY use byte strings as scope values, to achieve compact encoding of large scope elements.  The meaning of a specific scope value is application specific and expected to be known to the RS running that application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.p.4">If the AS needs to convey a hint to the RS about which profile it should use to communicate with the client, the AS MAY include a "profile" claim in the access token, with the same syntax and semantics as defined in <a href="#paramProfile">Section 5.6.4.3</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.8.1"><a href="#rfc.section.5.8.1">5.8.1.</a> <a href="#tokenAuthInfoEndpoint" id="tokenAuthInfoEndpoint">The Authorization Information Endpoint</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.1">The access token, containing authorization information and information about the key used by the client, needs to be transported to the RS so that the RS can authenticate and authorize the client request.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.2">This section defines a method for transporting the access token to the RS using a RESTful protocol such as CoAP. Profiles of this framework MAY define other methods for token transport.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.3">The method consists of an authz-info endpoint, implemented by the RS.  A client using this method MUST make a POST request to the authz-info endpoint at the RS with the access token in the payload. The RS receiving the token MUST verify the validity of the token.  If the token is valid, the RS MUST respond to the POST request with 2.01 (Created).  Section <a href="#verifyToken">Section 5.8.1.1</a> outlines how an RS MUST proceed to verify the validity of an access token.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.4">If the access token is a CWT and is sent via CoAP, the content format "application/cwt" MUST be used. If a token is sent via HTTP the equivalent media type "application/cwt" MUST be used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.5">The RS MUST be prepared to store at least one access token for future use. This is a difference to how access tokens are handled in OAuth 2.0, where the access token is typically sent along with each request, and therefore not stored at the RS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.6">If the payload sent to the authz-info endpoint does not parse to a token, the RS MUST respond with a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.7">The RS MAY make an introspection request to validate the token before responding to the POST request to the authz-info endpoint.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.8">Profiles MUST specify whether the authz-info endpoint is protected, including whether error responses from this endpoint are protected.  Note that since the token contains information that allow the client and the RS to establish a security context in the first place, mutual authentication may not be possible at this point.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.9">The default name of this endpoint in an url-path is '/authz-info', however implementations are not required to use this name and can define their own instead.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.p.10">A RS MAY use introspection on a token received through the authz-info endpoint, e.g. if the token is an opaque reference.  Some transport protocols may provide a way to indicate that the RS is busy and the client should retry after an interval; this type of status update would be appropriate while the RS is waiting for an introspection response.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.1.p.1">When an RS receives an access token, it MUST verify it before storing it. The verification is based on the claims of the token and its cryptographic wrapper (if any), so the RS needs to retrieve those claims.  If the claims cannot be retrieved the RS MUST discard the token and in case of an interaction via the authz-info endpoint, return an error message with a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.1.p.2">Since the cryptographic wrapper of the token (e.g. a COSE message) could include encryption, it needs to be verified first, based on shared cryptographic material with recognized AS.  If this verification fails, the RS MUST discard the token and if this was an interaction with authz-info it MUST respond with a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.01 (Unauthorized).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.1.p.3">The following claims MUST be checked if present, and errors returned when a check fails, in the order of priority of this list: </p>

  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The expiration date must be in the future. Note that this has to be verified again at access time.  If that is not the case the RS MUST respond with a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.01 (Unauthorized).</dd>
  <dt>aud</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The audience claim must refer to an audience that the RS identifies with. If that is not the case the RS MUST respond with a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.03 (Forbidden).</dd>

  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The RS must recognize value of the scope claim.  If that is not the case the RS MUST respond with a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request).  The RS MAY provide additional information in the error response, in order to clarify what went wrong.</dd>
</dl>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.1.p.4">If the access token contains any other claims that the RS cannot process the RS MUST respond with a response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.00 (Bad Request). The RS MAY provide additional detail in the error response to clarify which claim couldn't be processed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.1.p.5">Note that the Subject (sub) claim cannot always be verified when the token is submitted to the RS, since the client may not have authenticated yet. Also note that a counter for the expires_in (exi) claim MUST be initialized when the RS first verifies this token.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.1.p.6">When sending error responses, the RS MAY use the error codes from section 3.1 of <a href="#RFC6750">[RFC6750]</a>, in order to provide additional detail to the client.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.2.p.1">As this framework can be used in RESTful environments, it is important to make sure that attackers cannot perform unauthorized requests on the auth-info endpoints, other than submitting access tokens.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.2.p.2">Specifically it SHOULD NOT be possible to perform GET, DELETE or PUT on the authz-info endpoint and on it's children (if any).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.8.1.2.p.4">The RS SHOULD implement rate limiting measures to mitigate attacks aiming to overload the processing capacity of the RS by repeatedly submitting tokens.

<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.1">If an RS receives a request from a client, and the target resource requires authorization, the RS MUST first verify that it has an access token that authorizes this request, and that the client has performed the proof-of-possession for that token.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.2">The response code MUST be 4.01 (Unauthorized) in case the client has not performed the proof-of-possession, or if RS has no valid access token for the client. If RS has an access token for the client but not for the resource that was requested, RS MUST reject the request with a 4.03 (Forbidden). If RS has an access token for the client but it does not cover the action that was requested on the resource, RS MUST reject the request with a 4.05 (Method Not Allowed).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.3">Note: The use of the response codes 4.03 and 4.05 is intended to prevent infinite loops where a dumb Client optimistically tries to access a requested resource with any access token received from AS. As malicious clients could pretend to be C to determine C's privileges, these detailed response codes must be used only when a certain level of security is already available which can be achieved only when the Client is authenticated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.4">Note: The RS MAY use introspection for timely validation of an access token, at the time when a request is presented.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.5">Note: Matching the claims of the access token (e.g., scope) to a specific request is application specific.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.2.p.6">If the request matches a valid token and the client has performed the proof-of-possession for that token, the RS continues to process the request as specified by the underlying application.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5.8.3"><a href="#rfc.section.5.8.3">5.8.3.</a> <a href="#tokenExpiration" id="tokenExpiration">Token Expiration</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.3.p.1">Depending on the capabilities of the RS, there are various ways in which it can verify the expiration of a received access token.  Here follows a list of the possibilities including what functionality they require of the RS.</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The token is a CWT and includes an "exp" claim and possibly the "nbf" claim.  The RS verifies these by comparing them to values from its internal clock as defined in <a href="#RFC7519">[RFC7519]</a>.  In this case the RS's internal clock must reflect the current date and time, or at least be synchronized with the AS's clock.  How this clock synchronization would be performed is out of scope for this specification.</li>
  <li>The RS verifies the validity of the token by performing an introspection request as specified in <a href="#introspectionEndpoint">Section 5.7</a>.  This requires the RS to have a reliable network connection to the AS and to be able to handle two secure sessions in parallel (C to RS and AS to RS).</li>
  <li>In order to support token expiration for devices that have no reliable way of synchronizing their internal clocks, this specification defines the following approach: The claim "exi" ("expires in") can be used, to provide the RS with the lifetime of the token in seconds from the time the RS first receives the token.  This approach is of course vulnerable to malicious clients holding back tokens they do not want to expire. Such an attack can only be prevented if the RS is able to communicate with the AS in some regular intervals, so that the can AS provide the RS with a list of expired tokens.  The drawback of this mitigation is that the RS might as well use the communication with the AS to synchronize its internal clock.  </li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.8.3.p.3">If a token that authorizes a long running request such as a CoAP Observe <a href="#RFC7641">[RFC7641]</a> expires, the RS MUST send an error response with the response code equivalent to the CoAP code 4.01 (Unauthorized) to the client and then terminate processing the long running request.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6"><a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#security" id="security">Security Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">Security considerations applicable to authentication and authorization in RESTful environments provided in OAuth 2.0 <a href="#RFC6749">[RFC6749]</a> apply to this work.  Furthermore <a href="#RFC6819">[RFC6819]</a> provides additional security considerations for OAuth which apply to IoT deployments as well.  If the introspection endpoint is used, the security considerations from <a href="#RFC7662">[RFC7662]</a> also apply.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">A large range of threats can be mitigated by protecting the contents of the access token by using a digital signature or a keyed message digest (MAC) or an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm.  Consequently, the token integrity protection MUST be applied to prevent the token from being modified, particularly since it contains a reference to the symmetric key or the asymmetric key.  If the access token contains the symmetric key, this symmetric key MUST be encrypted by the authorization server so that only the resource server can decrypt it.  Note that using an AEAD algorithm is preferable over using a MAC unless the message needs to be publicly readable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">It is important for the authorization server to include the identity of the intended recipient (the audience), typically a single resource server (or a list of resource servers), in the token.  Using a single shared secret with multiple resource servers to simplify key management is NOT RECOMMENDED since the benefit from using the proof-of-possession concept is significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.4">The authorization server MUST offer confidentiality protection for any interactions with the client.  This step is extremely important since the client may obtain the proof-of-possession key from the authorization server for use with a specific access token.  Not using confidentiality protection exposes this secret (and the access token) to an eavesdropper thereby completely negating proof-of-possession security.  Profiles MUST specify how confidentiality protection is provided, and additional protection can be applied by encrypting the token, for example encryption of CWTs is specified in Section 5.1 of <a href="#RFC8392">[RFC8392]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.5">Developers MUST ensure that the ephemeral credentials (i.e., the private key or the session key) are not leaked to third parties.  An adversary in possession of the ephemeral credentials bound to the access token will be able to impersonate the client.  Be aware that this is a real risk with many constrained environments, since adversaries can often easily get physical access to the devices.  This risk can also be mitigated to some extent by making sure that keys are refreshed more frequently.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.6">If clients are capable of doing so, they should frequently request fresh access tokens, as this allows the AS to keep the lifetime of the tokens short. This allows the AS to use shorter proof-of-possession key sizes, which translate to a performance benefit for the client and for the resource server.  Shorter keys also lead to shorter messages (particularly with asymmetric keying material).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.7">When authorization servers bind symmetric keys to access tokens, they SHOULD scope these access tokens to a specific permission.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.1"><a href="#rfc.section.6.1">6.1.</a> <a href="#unprotected-as-information" id="unprotected-as-information">Unprotected AS Information</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">Initially, no secure channel exists to protect the communication between C and RS. Thus, C cannot determine if the AS information contained in an unprotected response from RS to an unauthorized request (see <a href="#asInfo">Section 5.1.2</a>) is authentic. It is therefore advisable to provide C with a (possibly hard-coded) list of trustworthy authorization servers. AS information responses referring to a URI not listed there would be ignored.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>C-AS</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">All communication between the client and the Authorization Server MUST be encrypted, integrity and replay protected. Furthermore responses from the AS to the client MUST be bound to the client's request to avoid attacks where the attacker swaps the intended response for an older one valid for a previous request.  This requires that the client and the Authorization Server have previously exchanged either a shared secret, or their public keys in order to negotiate a secure communication. Furthermore the client MUST be able to determine whether an AS has the authority to issue access tokens for a certain RS.  This can be done through pre-configured lists, or through an online lookup mechanism that in turn also must be secured.  </dd>
  <dt>RS-AS</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The communication between the Resource Server and the Authorization Server via the introspection endpoint MUST be encrypted, integrity and replay protected. Furthermore responses from the AS to the RS MUST be bound to the RS's request.  This requires that the client and the Authorization Server have previously exchanged either a shared secret, or their public keys in order to negotiate a secure communication. Furthermore the RS MUST be able to determine whether an AS has the authority to issue access tokens itself.  This is usually configured out of band, but could also be performed through an online lookup mechanism provided that it is also secured in the same way.</dd>
  <dt>C-RS</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The initial communication between the client and the Resource Server can not be secured in general, since the RS is not in possession of on access token for that client, which would carry the necessary parameters.  Certain security mechanisms (e.g. DTLS with server-side authentication via a certificate or a raw public key) can be possible and are RECOMMEND if supported by both parties.  After the client has successfully transmitted the access token to the RS, a secure communication protocol MUST be established between client and RS for the actual resource request.  This protocol MUST provide encryption, integrity and replay protection as well as a binding between requests and responses.  This requires that the client learned either the RS's public key or received a symmetric proof-of-possession key bound to the access token from the AS.  The RS must have learned either the client's public key or a shared symmetric key from the claims in the token or an introspection request.  Since ACE does not provide profile negotiation between C and RS, the client MUST have learned what profile the RS supports (e.g. from the AS or pre-configured) and initiate the communication accordingly.</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.1">The RS may add a nonce to the AS Information message sent as a response to an unauthorized request to ensure freshness of an Access Token subsequently presented to RS. While a time-stamp of some granularity would be sufficient to protect against replay attacks, using randomized nonce is preferred to prevent disclosure of information about RS's internal clock characteristics.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.1">There may be use cases were different profiles of this framework are combined.  For example, an MQTT-TLS profile is used between the client and the RS in combination with a CoAP-DTLS profile for interactions between the client and the AS. Ideally, profiles should be designed in a way that the security of system should not depend on the specific security mechanisms used in individual protocol interactions.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6.5"><a href="#rfc.section.6.5">6.5.</a> <a href="#infoLeak" id="infoLeak">Unprotected Information</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.1">Communication with the authz-info endpoint, as well as the various error responses defined in this framework all potentially include sending information over an unprotected channel.  These messages may leak information to an adversary.  For example errors responses for requests to the Authorization Information endpoint can reveal information about an otherwise opaque access token to an adversary who has intercepted this token.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.2">As far as error messages are concerned, this framework is written under the assumption that, in general, the benefits of detailed error messages outweigh the risk due to information leakage. For particular use cases, where this assessment does not apply, detailed error messages can be replaced by more generic ones.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.3">In some scenarios it may be possible to protect the communication with the authz-info endpoint (e.g. through DTLS with only server-side authentication). In cases where this is not possible this framework RECOMMENDS to use encrypted CWTs or opaque references and need to be subjected to introspection by the RS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.5.p.4">If the initial unauthorized resource request message (see <a href="#rreq">Section 5.1.1</a>) is used, the client MUST make sure that it is not sending sensitive content in this request.

<h1 id="rfc.section.6.6"><a href="#rfc.section.6.6">6.6.</a> <a href="#introDos" id="introDos">Denial of service against or with      Introspection</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.1">The optional introspection mechanism provided by OAuth and supported in the ACE framework allows for two types of attacks that need to be considered by implementers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.2">First an attacker could perform a denial of service attack against the introspection endpoint at the AS in order to prevent validation of access tokens.  To mitigate this attack, an RS that is configured to use introspection MUST NOT allow access based on a token for which it couln't reach the introspection endpoint.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.6.p.3">Second an attacker could use the fact that an RS performs introspection to perform a denial of service attack against that RS by repeatedly sending tokens to its authz-info endpoint that require an introspection call. RS can mitigate such attacks by implementing a rate limit on how many introspection requests they perform in a given time intervall and rejecting incoming requests to authz-info for a certain amount of time, when that rate limit has been reached.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7"><a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#privacy" id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">Implementers and users should be aware of the privacy implications of the different possible deployments of this framework.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">The AS is in a very central position and can potentially learn sensitive information about the clients requesting access tokens.  If the client credentials grant is used, the AS can track what kind of access the client intends to perform.  With other grants this can be prevented by the Resource Owner.  To do so, the resource owner needs to bind the grants it issues to anonymous, ephemeral credentials that do not allow the AS to link different grants and thus different access token requests by the same client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">If access tokens are only integrity protected and not encrypted, they may reveal information to attackers listening on the wire, or able to acquire the access tokens in some other way.  In the case of CWTs the token may, e.g., reveal the audience, the scope and the confirmation method used by the client.  The latter may reveal the identity of the device or application running the client.  This may be linkable to the identity of the person using the client (if there is a person and not a machine-to-machine interaction).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">Clients using asymmetric keys for proof-of-possession should be aware of the consequences of using the same key pair for proof-of-possession towards different RSs.  A set of colluding RSs or an attacker able to obtain the access tokens will be able to link the requests, or even to determine the client's identity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.5">An unprotected response to an unauthorized request (see <a href="#asInfo">Section 5.1.2</a>) may disclose information about RS and/or its existing relationship with C. It is advisable to include as little information as possible in an unencrypted response. Means of encrypting communication between C and RS already exist, more detailed information may be included with an error response to provide C with sufficient information to react on that particular error.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A">Appendix A.</a> <a href="#constraints" id="constraints">Design Justification</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">This section provides further insight into the design decisions of the solution documented in this document.  <a href="#overview">Section 3</a> lists several building blocks and briefly summarizes their importance.  The justification for offering some of those building blocks, as opposed to using OAuth 2.0 as is, is given below.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.2">Common IoT constraints are: </p>

<dl>
  <dt>Low Power Radio:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> Many IoT devices are equipped with a small battery which needs to last for a long time.  For many constrained wireless devices, the highest energy cost is associated to transmitting or receiving messages (roughly by a factor of 10 compared to AES) <a href="#Margi10impact">[Margi10impact]</a>.  It is therefore important to keep the total communication overhead low, including minimizing the number and size of messages sent and received, which has an impact of choice on the message format and protocol.  By using CoAP over UDP and CBOR encoded messages, some of these aspects are addressed.  Security protocols contribute to the communication overhead and can, in some cases, be optimized.  For example, authentication and key establishment may, in certain cases where security requirements allow, be replaced by provisioning of security context by a trusted third party, using transport or application layer security.  <br/> </dd>
  <dt>Low CPU Speed:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> Some IoT devices are equipped with processors that are significantly slower than those found in most current devices on the Internet.  This typically has implications on what timely cryptographic operations a device is capable of performing, which in turn impacts, e.g., protocol latency.  Symmetric key cryptography may be used instead of the computationally more expensive public key cryptography where the security requirements so allows, but this may also require support for trusted third party assisted secret key establishment using transport or application layer security.  <br/></dd>
  <dt>Small Amount of Memory:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> Microcontrollers embedded in IoT devices are often equipped with small amount of RAM and flash memory, which places limitations what kind of processing can be performed and how much code can be put on those devices.  To reduce code size fewer and smaller protocol implementations can be put on the firmware of such a device.  In this case, CoAP may be used instead of HTTP,  symmetric key cryptography instead of public key cryptography, and CBOR instead of JSON.  Authentication and key establishment protocol, e.g., the DTLS handshake,  in comparison with assisted key establishment also has an impact on memory and code.<br/> </dd>
  <dt>User Interface Limitations:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> Protecting access to resources is both an important security as well as privacy feature.  End users and enterprise customers may not want to give access to the data collected by their IoT device or to functions it may offer to third parties.  Since the classical approach of requesting permissions from end users via a rich user interface does not work in many IoT deployment scenarios, these functions need to be delegated to user-controlled devices that are better suitable for such tasks, such as smart phones and tablets.  <br/><br/></dd>
  <dt>Communication Constraints:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> In certain constrained settings an IoT device may not be able to communicate with a given device at all times.  Devices may be sleeping, or just disconnected from the Internet because of general lack of connectivity in the area, for cost reasons, or for security reasons, e.g., to avoid an entry point for Denial-of-Service attacks.  <br/><br/> The communication interactions this framework builds upon (as shown graphically in <a href="#fig:protocolFlow">Figure 1</a>) may be accomplished using a variety of different protocols, and not all parts of the message flow are used in all applications due to the communication constraints.  Deployments making use of CoAP are expected, but not limited to, other protocols such as HTTP, HTTP/2 or other specific protocols, such as Bluetooth Smart communication, that do not necessarily use IP could also be used.  The latter raises the need for application layer security over the various interfaces.</dd>
</dl>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.3">In the light of these constraints we have made the following design decisions: </p>

<dl>
  <dt>CBOR, COSE, CWT:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> This framework RECOMMENDS the use of CBOR <a href="#RFC7049">[RFC7049]</a> as data format.  Where CBOR data needs to be protected, the use of COSE <a href="#RFC8152">[RFC8152]</a> is RECOMMENDED.  Furthermore where self-contained tokens are needed, this framework RECOMMENDS the use of CWT <a href="#RFC8392">[RFC8392]</a>.  These measures aim at reducing the size of messages sent over the wire, the RAM size of data objects that need to be kept in memory and the size of libraries that devices need to support.  <br/><br/></dd>
  <dt>CoAP:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> This framework RECOMMENDS the use of CoAP <a href="#RFC7252">[RFC7252]</a> instead of HTTP.  This does not preclude the use of other protocols specifically aimed at constrained devices, like, e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy (see <a href="#coap">Section 3.2</a>).  This aims again at reducing the size of messages sent over the wire, the RAM size of data objects that need to be kept in memory and the size of libraries that devices need to support.  <br/><br/></dd>
  <dt>Access Information:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> This framework defines the name "Access Information" for data concerning the RS that the AS returns to the client in an access token response (see  <a href="#tokenResponse">Section 5.6.2</a>).  This aims at enabling scenarios, where a powerful client, supporting multiple profiles, needs to interact with a RS for which it does not know the supported profiles and the raw public key.  <br/><br/></dd>
  <dt>Proof-of-Possession:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> This framework makes use of proof-of-possession tokens, using the "cnf" claim <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession">[I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession]</a>. A semantically and syntactically identical request and response parameter is defined for the token endpoint, to allow requesting and stating confirmation keys.  This aims at making token theft harder. Token theft is specifically relevant in constrained use cases, as communication often passes through middle-boxes, which could be able to steal bearer tokens and use them to gain unauthorized access.  <br/><br/> </dd>
  <dt>Auth-Info endpoint:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> This framework introduces a new way of providing access tokens to a RS by exposing a authz-info endpoint, to which access tokens can be POSTed.  This aims at reducing the size of the request message and the code complexity at the RS.  The size of the request message is problematic, since many constrained protocols have severe message size limitations at the physical layer (e.g., in the order of 100 bytes). This means that larger packets get fragmented, which in turn combines badly with the high rate of packet loss, and the need to retransmit the whole message if one packet gets lost.  Thus separating sending of the request and sending of the access tokens helps to reduce fragmentation.  <br/><br/></dd>
  <dt>Client Credentials Grant:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> This framework RECOMMENDS the use of the client credentials grant for machine-to-machine communication use cases, where manual intervention of the resource owner to produce a grant token is not feasible.  The intention is that the resource owner would instead pre-arrange authorization with the AS, based on the client's own credentials.  The client can then (without manual intervention) obtain access tokens from the AS.  <br/><br/></dd>
  <dt>Introspection:</dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8"><br/><br/> This framework RECOMMENDS the use of access token introspection in cases where the client is constrained in a way that it can not easily obtain new access tokens (i.e. it has connectivity issues that prevent it from communicating with the AS). In that case this framework RECOMMENDS the use of a long-term token, that could be a simple reference.  The RS is assumed to be able to communicate with the AS, and can therefore perform introspection, in order to learn the claims associated with the token reference.  The advantage of such an approach is that the resource owner can change the claims associated to the token reference without having to be in contact with the client, thus granting or revoking access rights.  <br/><br/></dd>

<p id="rfc.section.E.p.2">For each of the deployment variants, there are a number of possible security setups between clients, resource servers and authorization servers.  The main focus in the following subsections is on how authorization of a client request for a resource hosted by a RS is performed.  This requires the security of the requests and responses between the clients and the RS to consider.  </p>

  <dt></dt>
  <dd style="margin-left: 8">The client sends the POST request to the token endpoint at the AS.  The security of this request can be transport or application layer. It is up the the communication security profile to define. In the example transport layer identification of the AS is done and the client identifies with client_id and client_secret as in classic OAuth.

The PoP access token contains the public key of the client, and the Access Information  contains the public key of the RS.  For communication security this example uses DTLS RawPublicKey between the client and the RS. The issued token will have a short validity time, i.e., "exp" close to "iat", to protect the RS from replay attacks. The token includes the claim such as "scope" with the authorized access that an owner of the temperature device can enjoy.  In this example, the "scope" claim, issued by the AS, informs the RS that the owner of the token, that can prove the possession of a key is authorized to make a GET request against the /temperature resource and a POST request on the /firmware resource.  Note that the syntax and semantics of the scope claim are application specific.</dd>

<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.1">In this deployment scenario it is assumed that a client is not able to access the AS at the time of the access request, whereas the RS is assumed to be connected to the back-end infrastructure. Thus the RS can make use of token introspection.  This access procedure involves steps A-F of <a href="#fig:protocolFlow">Figure 1</a>, but assumes steps A and B have been carried out during a phase when the client had connectivity to AS.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.2">Since the client is assumed to be offline, at least for a certain period of time, a pre-provisioned access token has to be long-lived.  Since the client is constrained, the token will not be self contained (i.e. not a CWT) but instead just a reference.  The resource server uses its connectivity to learn about the claims associated to the access token by using introspection, which is shown in the example below.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.3">In the example interactions between an offline client (key fob), a RS (online lock), and an AS is shown.  It is assumed that there is a provisioning step where the client has access to the AS.  This corresponds to message exchanges A and B which are shown in <a href="#fig:cOffline">Figure 22</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.4">Authorization consent from the resource owner can be pre-configured, but it can also be provided via an interactive flow with the resource owner.  An example of this for the key fob case could be that the resource owner has a connected car, he buys a generic key that he wants to use with the car.  To authorize the key fob he connects it to his computer that then provides the UI for the device.  After that OAuth 2.0 implicit flow can used to authorize the key for his car at the the car manufacturers AS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.5">Note: In this example the client does not know the exact door it will be used to access since the token request is not send at the time of access. So the scope and audience parameters are set quite wide to start with and new values different form the original once can be returned from introspection later on.</p>

Since the token is an opaque string, the RS cannot verify it on its own, and thus defers to respond the client with a status code until after step E.</dd>

Introspection assumes a secure connection between the AS and the RS, e.g., using transport of application layer security.
